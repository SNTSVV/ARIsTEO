The pendulum is the simplest mechanical system you can model. 
This system contains two bodies, a link and a fixed pivot, connected by a revolute joint. 

The goal is to find an input for the applied moment M such that the pendulom reaches a y that s higher than 0, i.e.,
the pendolumn "is above the x axis" (when the property is violated the pendulum becomes red)
